# Store & User Page 

---

Notes:

- *`Users' password`*: for easy testing, all the users should have *the same password*. Password will be encrypted in database (you can't read it). I can tell you that all the user has the password of  **12345**. ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°) shhhh ~ 

- *`Website URL`*: for easy testing, the URL is 'http://localhost:5000'. So that, before deploying on Heroku, please change it to 'https://team468-bookstore.herokuapp.com/' in *.env* file.
